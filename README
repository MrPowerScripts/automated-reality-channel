Automated Reality Channel

This repository hosts the script files that generate the videos for ARC (Automated Reality Channel)

This is an increadibly stupid project by MrPowerScripts https://mrpowerscripts.com

Basically the idea is to create a "Netflix with voting".

The money you pay on [the Patreon](https://bit.ly/mrps-patreon) all goes directly to creating content for this channel. Paying people to create art, video editing, voice overs, or whatever else is needed for video production. The kicker is that you get to vote on every content decision [in the Discord channel](https://bit.ly/mrps-discord) with emoji. When you donate on Patreon you automatically get a role that allows you to vote on motions or content drafts simply by clicking an emoji. How amazing and dumb is that? So the channel literally is "you get what you pay for". 

In this repository you'lld see a scripts folder. This is where the scripts for each episode are stored. The discord bot pulls the scripts and automatically generates the episodes based on the script files. How cool is that? It's pretty neato friend.

If you want to learn more stop by the [the Discord channel](https://bit.ly/mrps-discord).
